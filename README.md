## Known Issues / Test Observations

- Search Keyword Sensitivity
  Searching for `"Tshirt"` returns 6 results, while `"T-shirt"` returns only 3.  
  All `"T-shirt"` results are included in the `"Tshirt"` results.  
  This shows that the search engine is **sensitive to special characters** like hyphens.

  âœ… Suggestion: Normalize search input or improve fuzzy matching to include results for common variations like `T shirt`, `T-shirt`, and `Tshirt`.
